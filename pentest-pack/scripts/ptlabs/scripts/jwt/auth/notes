part 1 and 2 changed to the desired contents...
just need to figure out how to create the signature...

{"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256"}.{"login":"admin"}.<<sig>>

# using python base64 lib base64.urlsafe_b64encode:

eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJsb2dpbiI6ImFkbWluIn0=.


# Solved::

on https://jwt.io

- put jwt auth token in the field on the left

- edit the data to HS256, and login:admin

- base64 encode the public key and enter that in as the secret

(public key found by curl -vi <url>/public.pem )

nice! you are now an admin!
