# DNS Recon

Finding subdomains is fundamental. The more subdomains you find, the bigger attack surface you have. Which means bigger possibility of success.

For now this seems to be a very comprehensive list of tools to find subdomains. [https://blog.bugcrowd.com/discovering-subdomains](https://blog.bugcrowd.com/discovering-subdomains)​

Some tools find some stuff, other tools other stuff. So your best bet is to use a few of them together. Don't forget to brute-force recursively!

### recon-ng {#recon-ng}

In order to find subdomains we can use the recon-ng framework. It has the same basic structure as metasploit. You can learn more about this tool in the tools-section.

```text
recon-ng​use use recon/domains-hosts/​# This will give you a vast amount of alternatives.​show options​set source cnn.com
```

All these subdomains will be saved in `hosts`, which you can access though: `show hosts`

If some of these subdomains are not given IPs automatically you can just run

```text
use recon/hosts-hosts/resolverun
```

And it will resolve all the hosts in the hosts-file.

### Google Dorks {#google-dorks}

Using google we can also find subdomains.

This will only give us the subdomains of a site.

`site:msn.com -site:www.msn.com`

`site:*.nextcloud.com`

To exclude a specific subdomain you can do this:

`site:*.nextcloud.com -site:help.nextcloud.com`

### subbrute.py {#subbrute-py}

The basic command is like this

`./subbrute.py -p cnn.com`

### Being smart {#being-smart}

You also have to look at what kind of system the target has. Some web-apps give their clients their own subdomains. Like github.

Check out the homepage Often companies brag about their clients. You can use this to guess the subdomains of some clients.

### Reverse DNS-lookup {#reverse-dns-lookup}

If you manage to figure out the IP range that the target owns \(see section about nmap below\). You can see which machines are online. And then you can run a script to find out the domain-addresses of those machines. That way you might find something new.

The text-file onlyIps.txt is a textfile with one IP-address on each line.

```text
#!/bin/bash​while read p; do  echo $p;  host  $pdone <onlyIps.txt
```

### Brute force dictionaries {#brute-force-dictionaries}

If you try to brute force the domains it is a good idea to have a good dictionary. That can be found here:
