# Researching People

## Identifying People {#identifying-people}

We want to find out how is connected to the target. That can be site administrator, employees, owner, mods. Maybe one of the administrators posted in a forum with their email, or in a newsgroup or somewhere else. Those posts could contain useful data about the targets technology stack or help us devlop a network diagram. Social Engineering can come into play here.

In order to find people we might use the following sources:

* The company website
* Social media \(LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter etc\)
* Forums and newsgroups
* Metadata from documents

#### Company Website {#company-website}

This is pretty obvious. Just look around on the website. Or download it. Or spider it with burp and then search the result.

Make sure to check out the blog. There you might have employees writing blogposts under their name.

#### Social Media {#social-media}

```text
site:twitter.com companynamesite:linkedin.com companynamesite:facebook.com companyname
```

#### Metadata From Documents {#metadata-from-documents}

You find some documents and then run exiftool on them to see if there is any interesting metadata.

```text
site:example.com filetype:pdf
```
