# Enumerating Content

## Tools & Resources

There is essentially no way for a user to know which files are found in which directories on a web-server, unless the whole server has directory listing by default. However, if you go directly to the page it will be shown. So what the attacker can do is to brute force hidden files and directories. Just test a bunch of them. There are several tools for doing this. The attack is of course very noisy and will show up fast in the logs.

### Nikto

```text
# Basic Scan  *Default port is 80 for http, and 443 for https
$ nikto -h http://<RHOST>:<RPORT>

# Full check for cgi scripts
$ nikto -C all -h http://<RHOST>:<RPORT>
```

### Dirb {#dirb}

This is a really easy tool to use:

```text
$ dirb http://target.com
```

### Dirbuster {#dirbuster}

This one is a GUI You start it with:

```text
$ dirbuster
```

### OWASP ZAP {#owasp-zap}

Insert your target. Add it to the context Click the plus-sign Click on Forced Browse

### Wfuzz {#wfuzz}

```text
wfuzz -c -z file,/root/.ZAP/fuzzers/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-big.txt --sc 200 http://<RHOST>:8088/FUZZ.php
```

### Gobuster {#gobuster}

```text
$ gobuster -u http://<RHOST> -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web_Content/common.txt -s '200,204,301,302,307,403,500' -e
```

### WAF - Web application firewall

When 403 errors are returned, this could either mean there is some sort of authentication setup on the site denying you access or there could be a WAF protecting the site. It may be possible to circumvent the WAF by changing our request header to make it look more like a normal request.

```text
dirb http://target.com -a "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.106 Safari/537.36"
```

### Web Proxies

* Burp Suite    \(I recommend the Pro version, it offers a lot more functionality\)
* OWASP ZAP
