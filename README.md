# Cyber Security Guide

## Overview

This guide will be a work-in-progress that I'm planning on continuing to update and fill out as I have time / learn new things that I want to remember. Also, to anyone who finds this guide or is reading it I truely hope it helps. Starting out I remember finding great information everywhere but it was so spread out between multiple guides, forum posts, blogs, etc. So my goal is to get all of that information in one place instead of having to jump around everywhere looking for things.

You're welcome to clone or fork my github repo where this book can be found with at:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lamontns/pentest.git
```


Some of this will be my personal notes but there will also be a lot of content pulled from other guides and things. I'll do my best to include links to the original content as well.



## Additional Info

### Throughout the guide I'll try my best to keep everything in the same syntax to avoid confusion.

**RHOST** = the remote host you are attacking / connecting to

**RPORT** = The remote port

**LHOST** = The attacking machine \(Your IP Address on the network\)

**LPORT** = The port you are listening on for remote connections \(ex. reverse shells\)
