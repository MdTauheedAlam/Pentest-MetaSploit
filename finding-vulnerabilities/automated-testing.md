# Automated Testing

## Mass Vulnerability Scanners

### OpenVAS

* Free and Open Source
* In Kali by default
* Enumeration and checks for many known vulnerabilities
* Open Source offshoot from when Nessus it stopped being opensource

```text
$ openvas-setup

**REMEMBER KEEP TRACK OF THE PASSWORD IT GENERATES FOR YOU!!!**

# Web Interface
$ openvas-start
$ firefox https://127.0.0.1:9392/login/login.html
```

{% hint style="danger" %}

* Very Loud on the network
* Finds vulnerabilities based on comprehensive list of CVE's etc.
  * \(these are not necessarily exploitable\)
  * Can crash certain network services and overload older machines

## Server side scanning {#server-side-scanning}

### Nessus {#nessus}

Register and download it here. [http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-home](http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-home)â€‹

Then

```text
dpkg -i nameOfFile
```

Start it

```text
/etc/init.d/nessusd start
```

### Nmap Scripting Engine {#nmap-scripting-engine}

Scripts are found on kali at:

```text
/usr/share/nmap/scripts
```

```text
nmap --script-help default
```

Or for a specific script:

```text
nmap --script-help nameOfScript
```

Run all default scripts together with a port-scan. These scripts could possibily crash certain servers. Causing a denial-of-service. So never run this on production servers.

```text
nmap -sC 192.168.1.101
```

Nmap has categoriesed their scripts into several different categories to make it easier to run a few of them together

```text
uth
broadcast
default
discovery
dos
exploit
external
fuzzer
intrusive
malware
safe 
version
vuln
```

So if you want to test all the vuln-scripts you do

```text
nmap 192.168.1.10 -sC vuln
```

## Web Application Scanners {#web-application-scanner}

### Nikto {#nikto}

```text
nikto -h example.com
```

### Burp Suite Pro

My personal favorite, Burp Suite is a web application proxy with some really awesome features:

* Creates a site map as you browse  \(spidering will also fill out the sitemap\)
* Repeater to quickly edit and resend requests such as payloads to assess any differences in the response
* Intruder can do anything from bruteforce logins, to content discovery, to fuzzing, to blind sql injection
* Pro Version has active and passive scanners as you browse as well as source code analysis
* Many addon modules can be loaded to increase Burp's functionality even more \(Best one's are Pro Version only\)

### Uniscan {#uniscan}

```text
uniscan -h 192.168.1.102
```

### Metasploit - Wmap {#metasploit-wamp}

Wmap import module

```text
msf> load wmap
msf> wmap help
```
